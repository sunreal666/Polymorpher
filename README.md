The AI model will suggest code transformation strategies, such as:

Which sections should be renamed.

Which bytes should be swapped or replaced.

How to obscure specific functions or operations to avoid detection.

Use Custom AI Models:

Provide mutation strategies based on:

The analysis of existing malware behaviors.

Code patterns recognized as "signature-like."

Dynamic Mutation Based on AI:

Instead of just random transformations, the AI will suggest specific changes based on patterns seen in the target binary.

This could include:

Bytecode alterations (instruction-level transformation).

Control flow alterations (e.g., jump instructions, loops).

Data encoding (e.g., obfuscating strings/data).

The code now includes AI-guided mutation where:

The binary content is passed to GPT-3/4 (via the OpenAI API).

GPT analyzes the binary's first 100 bytes (or more) and suggests mutation techniques.

The mutation suggestions are applied to the binary (i.e., rename sections, add NOPs, reorder instructions).

This makes the transformation intelligent, adapting based on the content of the binary.
