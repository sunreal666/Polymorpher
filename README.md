The AI model will suggest code transformation strategies, such as:

Which sections should be renamed.

Which bytes should be swapped or replaced.

How to obscure specific functions or operations to avoid detection.

Use Custom AI Models:

Provide mutation strategies based on:

The analysis of existing malware behaviors.

Code patterns recognized as "signature-like."

Dynamic Mutation Based on AI:

Instead of just random transformations, the AI will suggest specific changes based on patterns seen in the target binary.

This could include:

Bytecode alterations (instruction-level transformation).

Control flow alterations (e.g., jump instructions, loops).

Data encoding (e.g., obfuscating strings/data).
